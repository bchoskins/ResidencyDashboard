# ResidencyDashboard

A project I am currently working on to help my fiance in the process of searching for a Residency program. I pulled the data from https://apps.acgme.org/ads/Public and wrote a data cleaning script ResidencyDataCleaning.Rmd. This data is then used in an R shiny application for her to utilize.
